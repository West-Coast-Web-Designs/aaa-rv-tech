    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                    Hey, I’m the face behind AAA RV Tech—and I’ve been living
                    the RV life full-time since 2018. That means I know exactly
                    what it’s like when something breaks in your rig. Whether
                    it’s your fridge going warm, your roof springing a leak, or
                    your tanks causing trouble, I’ve been there. I’ve dealt with
                    it. And now, I help others get through it—quickly and
                    stress-free.
                </p>
                <h2 class="cs-heading">Why I started AAA RV Tech</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    After years on the road and more than a few frustrating
                    service experiences, I decided to do something about it. I
                    trained, got certified, and built this business to offer
                    what I wished existed: mobile, honest, professional RV
                    repair that actually comes to you.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    As an Advanced Certified RV Technician, I’m trained to
                    handle everything from appliance repairs to plumbing, solar
                    installs, roof work, and more. But beyond the skills and
                    certifications, I bring something else to every job—real
                    empathy. I treat every RV like it’s my own, because I know
                    how important it is to keep your home on wheels safe,
                    functional, and road-ready.
                </p>

                            No endless waiting, no dealership runaround. Just
                            real service, on your schedule.

                            and get to work.
